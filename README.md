# Unity 2D Tank Test

Just messing around with a 2D tank game in Unity, something I've been wanting to do for a while.

* Unity 5 on PC
* Scriping in C#
* Using https://github.com/JISyed/Unity-XboxCtrlrInput for XBox 360 controller input
* Left and right triggers for tread control. No backward movement just yet.
* Still figuring out the tank movement, inspiration from here: http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/97765/move-2d-tank-with-independently-controlled-treads
* Emphasizes the fact that I need to learn more advanced math
