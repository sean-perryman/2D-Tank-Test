# Unity 2D Tank Test



Just messing around with a 2D tank game in Unity, something I've been wanting to do for a while.



* Unity 5 on PC, scripting in C#

* Using https://github.com/JISyed/Unity-XboxCtrlrInput for XBox 360 controller input

* Left and right triggers for tread control. No backward movement just yet.

* Left and right bumpers to rotate turret
* A-button to shoot
* ~~Still figuring out the tank movement~~, inspiration from here: http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/97765/move-2d-tank-with-independently-controlled-treads
* Emphasizes the fact that I need to learn more advanced math
